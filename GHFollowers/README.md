# GitHub Followers

This iOS mobile app allows you to view the followers of any GitHub user by their username. Using requests to the GitHub API, the app retrieves necessary information such as name, avatar, number of repositories, and displays it on the screen with custom UI elements.

  
**Key features of the app:**

•  Search for followers by GitHub username.

•  View a specific follower’s profile on GitHub.

•  Browse through a user’s list of followers and add selected users to the “Favorites” tab for easy access.

•  Dynamic interface updates after receiving data from the API.
  

This project was created as part of Sean Allen’s course and provides practical experience in working with the GitHub API, asynchronous requests, and developing custom interfaces for iOS mobile applications.
